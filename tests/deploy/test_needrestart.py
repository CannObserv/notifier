"""needrestart lists restarts and never performs them (#91).

apt's ``DPkg::Post-Invoke`` hook (``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99needrestart``) runs
``needrestart -m u`` after every dpkg run. Ubuntu's patch turns ``-m u`` into
**automatic** restarts when ``$nrconf{restart}`` is unset — the stock state —
so a ``libc6`` security update would restart ``notifier``, ``notifier-dev`` and
PostgreSQL mid-apply, outside any window. On this host that is the cohort's
alert path going down unannounced: no caller retries (#91, N1). The drop-in
makes the answer independent of whether ``NEEDRESTART_MODE=l`` survives every
process between the operator and the hook. Shape from CannObserv/broker#65.

Tracked in ``deploy/``, installed as:

- ``needrestart.conf.d/notifier.conf`` -> ``/etc/needrestart/conf.d/``

Pure assertions on the tracked copy run everywhere; installed-parity and live
assertions skip where the node is not this one, CI included.
